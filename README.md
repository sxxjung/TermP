## Welcome to our opensource SW term project
#### This repository is made for practice "Open source SW"

### 1. Project overview
- Our project synthesizes images by extracting only certain areas from the images. And we make “Annoying Orange”
- Anoying Orange is a character in a YouTube comedy series. The orange face is characterized by a composite of human eyes and mouth. It has gained popularity in Korea by translating and uploading lines. Orange is the main character, and other food ingredients such as vegetables and fruits appear.

### 3. Package used
- __opencv__ : it is an open source related to image processing and computer vision. It is equipped with state-of-the-art algorithms as well as traditional algorithms related to machine learning. It is used in various applications such as face recognition, 3d model extraction of objects, coordinate generation, image stitching image search, and eye movement tracking.
- __dlib__ : A high-performance library developed with c++ for image processing, machine learning, face recognition, and more.
- __numpy__ : embodied in the c language As a Python library, it was built for high-performance numerical calculations. It provides a very convenient function in vector and matrix operations.
- __imutils__ : It achieves the purpose of calling a simpler opencv interface with a package based on opencv. It is possible to easily realize a series of tasks such as image movement, rotation, enlargement, and framing.

### 4. How to execute
When you run the annoying orange.py file on Python, you can see the results in a window window.
